COVID-19 India Data Analysis and Visualization ðŸ“Š
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 data focused on India, exploring the spread, impact, and trends during the pandemic.
Using datasets from trusted sources, I applied data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization techniques to extract meaningful insights.

ðŸ“Œ Project Highlights:
Data Collection: COVID-19 datasets sourced from official government health departments and reliable repositories.

Data Cleaning and Preparation: Handled missing values, converted date formats, and removed irrelevant columns.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualized daily trends of confirmed, recovered, and death cases.

Analyzed top 10 states by active cases and deaths.

Identified patterns across different waves of the pandemic.

Vaccination Analysis:

Examined male vs female vaccination rates.

Highlighted the top 5 most vaccinated states.

Feature Engineering:

Created new features like daily active cases, recovery rates, and mortality rates.

Visualization Tools:

Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly were used for dynamic, interactive plots.

ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights:
Urban and densely populated regions experienced higher case loads.

Timely interventions like lockdowns and vaccinations significantly reduced new case numbers.

Recovery rates and mortality rates varied widely among different states.

Gender distribution showed slightly higher vaccination numbers for males compared to females.

ðŸš€ Future Scope:
Building a dynamic dashboard using Power BI (Work in Progress).

Integrating real-time COVID-19 data feeds.

Applying time-series forecasting for predicting future trends.
